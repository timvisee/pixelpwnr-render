# pixelpwnr render (WIP, prototype)
A blazingly fast GPU accelerated [pixelflut][pixelflut] ([video][pixelflut-video])
renderer in [Rust][rust], for use in a high performance pixelflut server.

This is just a renderer, and is intended to be implemented in a server.  
For a quick server implementation using this renderer, see:  
[â†’ pixelpwnr-server (server)][pixelpwnr-server]

**Note:** This is currently an experiment, and is heavily tested with.
This prototype renderer will be implemented in a quick server if successful. 

## Features
* Blazingly fast pixelflut rendering
* GPU accelerated
* Highly concurrent, to support many connections
* Linux, Windows and macOS
* ...

## Requirements
* Rust v1.25 (or higher)
* Build essentials (Ubuntu package: `build-essential`)
* `freetype2` development files (Ubuntu package: `libfreetype6-dev`)

## Relevant projects
* [pixelpwnr (client)][pixelpwnr]
* [pixelpwnr-server (server)][pixelpwnr-server]
